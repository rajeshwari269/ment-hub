# Menthub 👥

**Menthub** is a full-stack web platform designed to bridge the gap between college students seeking guidance (*mentees*) and those offering support (*mentors*) — all within the same academic environment.

It enables seamless mentor-mentee connections, encourages peer-driven learning, and promotes a culture of collaboration and growth.


## 🚀 Project Overview

Navigating college life — from academics and internships to placements and time management — can be challenging. **Menthub** was created to:

- Help students get guidance from peers in relevant areas.
- Enable peer-to-peer mentorship based on experience and skills.
- Enable students to **volunteer as mentors** based on their strengths.
- Provide a smart **profile-based matching system** using machine learning.
- Build a positive environment of support and shared growth.

Whether you're a first-year looking for advice or a final-year student ready to guide others — **Menthub** is for you.

## 📦 Installation Instructions

### ✅ Prerequisites:
- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL
- pip (Python package manager)

### 🛠️ Steps:

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/menthub.git
cd menthub
```

**2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
```bash
# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**3. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Set Up PostgreSQL Database**
Log in to PostgreSQL and create the database for the application.
```sql
-- Log in to psql first
sudo -u postgres psql

-- Then run this command inside the psql shell
CREATE DATABASE "Menthub";
```

**5. Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will store your secret keys and database connection string.

```properties
# .env file
SECRET_KEY='a_very_long_and_random_secret_key_here'
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI='postgresql://postgres:your_password@localhost/Menthub'
```
*Replace `your_password` with your actual PostgreSQL password.*

**6. Create Database Tables**
Run the following commands in your terminal to create the necessary tables in your database from your models.
```bash
# Open the Flask shell
flask shell

# Inside the Python shell, run these commands
>>> from app import db, app
>>> with app.app_context():
...     db.create_all()
...
>>> exit()
```
*This step is crucial to prevent "relation does not exist" errors.*

**7. Run the Flask App**
```bash
flask run
```
The application should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
